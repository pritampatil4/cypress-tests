# Github Actions - CI CD
Two files are added in `.github/workflows` folder.
 - `push.yml` in this file the events are such that when someone pushes the code, GH Actions will be triggered.
 - `pullrequest.yml` in this file the events are such that when pull-request is opened, re-opened, labeled or synchronize, GH Actions will be triggered.
